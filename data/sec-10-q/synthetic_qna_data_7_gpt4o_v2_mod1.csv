What are the major factors contributing to the change in Apple's gross margin in the most recent 10-Q compared to the previous quarters?,*AAPL*,Multi-Doc RAG,Text,"In the most recent 10-Q for the quarter ended July 1, 2023, the factors contributing to the change in Apple's gross margin compared to previous quarters include:

1. Weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin.
2. Lower Products volume, which decreased gross margin.
3. Cost savings and a different Products mix, which partially offset the decrease in gross margin.

For the third quarter of 2023, the Products gross margin percentage increased compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, despite the negative impact of foreign currency weakness and decreased leverage. However, the year-over-year Products gross margin percentage for the first nine months of 2023 decreased due to the weakness in foreign currencies and decreased leverage, despite cost savings and a different Products mix.

The Services gross margin increased due to higher Services net sales but was partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies and higher Services costs. The Services gross margin percentage decreased due to higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage.

If so, what are the main causes for this shift?",*NVDA*,Multi-Doc RAG,Table,"Yes, there has been a considerable shift in NVIDIA's operating costs over the reported quarters.

1. Acquisition Termination Cost: In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, NVIDIA recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion due to the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm Limited from SoftBank. This one-time cost significantly impacted operating expenses for that period.

For instance, research and development expenses were $1,945 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 and increased to $2,294 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.

4. Sales, General and Administrative Expenses: These expenses have also seen an increase. For example, they were $631 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 and rose to $689 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.

The lawsuit alleges that NVIDIA and certain executives violated the Securities Exchange Act by making false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The district court dismissed the complaint, but the decision was partially reversed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. NVIDIA's petition for rehearing was denied by the Ninth Circuit.

- As of October 30, 2022, the inventory was reported at $4,454 million (""2022 Q3 NVDA.pdf"").
- As of April 30, 2023, the inventory decreased to $4,319 million (""2023 Q1 NVDA.pdf"").
- As of July 30, 2023, the inventory slightly decreased to $4,319 million (""2023 Q2 NVDA.pdf"").
- As of October 29, 2023, the inventory increased to $4,779 million (""2023 Q3 NVDA.pdf"").

The changes in inventory levels indicate that NVIDIA has been actively managing its inventory in response to demand and supply chain conditions. The initial decrease from October 2022 to April 2023 could suggest efforts to align inventory with demand or improve supply chain efficiency. The slight decrease by July 2023 indicates a continued trend of managing inventory closely. However, the increase in inventory by October 2023 suggests that NVIDIA may be anticipating higher demand or facing supply chain challenges that require holding more inventory. This could also be a strategic move to secure components amidst global supply chain uncertainties.

1. European Commission Competition Matter: Intel was found to have used unfair business practices in 2009, resulting in a â‚¬1.1 billion fine, which was annulled in January 2022. The EC appealed the annulment, and Intel may be obligated to pay approximately â‚¬593 million in default interest if the appeal is unsuccessful. The EC reopened its administrative procedure to determine a fine against Intel based on alleged conduct not annulled by the General Court.

2. Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities: Intel faces multiple lawsuits related to the ""Spectre"" and ""Meltdown"" security vulnerabilities identified in 2017. Plaintiffs claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions and assert various common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief.

3. Litigation Related to 7 nm Product Delay Announcement: Following Intel's announcement of 7nm product delays in July 2020, multiple securities class action lawsuits were filed against Intel and certain officers. Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products.

4. Litigation Related to Patent and IP Claims: Intel is involved in IP infringement lawsuits, including those filed by VLSI Technology LLC, which involve claims that certain Intel products infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results could include substantial fines, penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing Intel from offering certain products or services.

5. EC-Imposed Fine: In the third quarter of 2023, Intel was charged a $401 million fine by the EC for an unspecified reason.

6. Termination of Agreement with Tower Semiconductor: Intel mutually agreed with Tower to terminate the acquisition agreement due to the inability to obtain required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, resulting in a $353 million termination fee charged to Intel in the third quarter of 2023.

"How have inventory levels at Intel changed over these quarters, and what might this suggest about their supply chain strategies?",*INTC*,Multi-Doc RAG,Table,"Over the quarters provided in the context, Intel's inventory levels have shown fluctuations:

- In Q3 2022, the inventory level was $13.224 billion (as stated in the ""2023 Q1 INTC.pdf"" document).
- In Q1 2023, the inventory level decreased to $12.993 billion (as stated in the ""2023 Q1 INTC.pdf"" document).
- In Q2 2023, the inventory level further decreased to $11.984 billion (as stated in the ""2023 Q2 INTC.pdf"" document).
